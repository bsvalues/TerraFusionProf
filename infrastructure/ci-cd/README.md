# CI/CD Pipeline Configuration for TerraFusionPro

This directory contains configuration files for the continuous integration and
continuous deployment pipelines for TerraFusionPro.

## Pipeline Overview

The CI/CD pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment of the TerraFusionPro
platform using GitHub Actions. The pipeline is triggered by pushes to specific
branches or pull requests.

## Workflow Files

- `ci.yml`: Continuous integration workflow for linting, testing, and building
- `cd-development.yml`: Deployment workflow for the development environment
- `cd-staging.yml`: Deployment workflow for the staging environment
- `cd-production.yml`: Deployment workflow for the production environment
- `release.yml`: Workflow for creating releases and generating changelogs

## Environment Configuration

Each environment (development, staging, production) has its own configuration
files and deployment workflows. Environment-specific variables are stored as
GitHub repository secrets.

## Pipeline Steps

1. **Code Validation**
   - Code linting
   - Unit tests
   - Static code analysis

2. **Build**
   - Building service images
   - Tagging images with Git SHA and environment

3. **Testing**
   - Running integration tests
   - End-to-end tests

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploying to Kubernetes cluster
   - Applying database migrations
   - Verifying deployment health

## Manual Approvals

Production deployments require manual approval from authorized team members
before proceeding. This is enforced using GitHub's environment protection rules.

## Rollback Procedure

In case of deployment failures, the pipeline automatically rolls back to the
previous known good state. Manual rollbacks can also be triggered through the
GitHub Actions interface.

## Monitoring and Notification

The pipeline integrates with monitoring and notification systems:

- Slack notifications for build and deployment status
- Email alerts for production deployments
- Integration with incident management systems

## Security Considerations

- Secrets are managed through GitHub Secrets
- Least privilege access for service accounts
- Automated security scanning of dependencies and container images
