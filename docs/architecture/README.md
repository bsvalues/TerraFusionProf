# TerraFusionPro Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architecture documentation for the TerraFusionPro platform.

## Overview

TerraFusionPro is designed as a cloud-native microservices architecture, built to provide
a scalable, resilient, and extensible platform for real estate appraisal. The architecture
follows domain-driven design principles with bounded contexts for each major functional area.

## System Architecture

The system consists of the following major components:

1. **API Gateway**: Entry point for all client requests, handling routing, authentication, and rate limiting
2. **Microservices**: Domain-specific services implementing business logic
3. **Data Storage**: Polyglot persistence with MongoDB for document storage and PostgreSQL for relational data
4. **Caching Layer**: Redis for caching and pub/sub messaging
5. **Frontend Applications**: Web client and field data collection apps
6. **AI Agents**: Specialized components for data analysis and validation

## Design Decisions

Key architectural decisions are documented as Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):

- [ADR-001: Microservices Architecture](./adrs/adr-001-microservices.md)
- [ADR-002: Polyglot Persistence](./adrs/adr-002-polyglot-persistence.md)
- [ADR-003: API Gateway Pattern](./adrs/adr-003-api-gateway.md)
- [ADR-004: Event-Driven Communication](./adrs/adr-004-event-driven.md)
- [ADR-005: AI Agent Architecture](./adrs/adr-005-ai-agents.md)

## Architecture Principles

1. **Modularity**: Services are designed around business capabilities
2. **API-First**: All functionality is exposed through well-defined APIs
3. **Statelessness**: Services are stateless to facilitate scaling and resilience
4. **Event-Driven**: Services communicate through events for loose coupling
5. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
6. **Observable**: Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing

## Technology Stack
