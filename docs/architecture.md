# TerraFusionPro Architecture

This document outlines the high-level architecture of the TerraFusionPro platform.

## Overview

TerraFusionPro is built using a microservices architecture pattern, organized in a monorepo structure. This approach allows for independent development and scaling of different system components while maintaining a unified codebase.

## Key Architectural Components

### Client-Facing Applications

- **Web Client**: Browser-based dashboard for appraisers, reviewers, and clients to access and manage reports
- **Field App**: Mobile application for on-site data collection and property inspections

### API Gateway

Central entry point for all client requests that handles:
- Authentication and authorization
- Request routing to appropriate microservices
- Response aggregation
- Rate limiting
- Protocol translation

### Microservices

Each microservice is responsible for a specific domain:

- **User Service**: Handles user management, authentication, and authorization
- **Property Service**: Manages property data, including characteristics, images, and metadata
- **Form Service**: Provides dynamic form templates and data validation for property inspection
- **Analysis Service**: Performs market analysis, comparable selection, and valuation calculations
- **Report Service**: Manages report generation, review workflow, and PDF creation

### AI Agents

Specialized components for intelligent data processing:

- **Data Validator**: Ensures data quality and consistency
- **Comparable Selector**: Finds and ranks comparable properties for valuation
- **QC Reviewer**: Performs quality control checks on reports
- **Market Analyzer**: Assesses market conditions and trends

### Shared Components

- **Schema**: Shared database schema definitions with Drizzle ORM
- **Storage**: Database connection and query utilities
- **Migrations**: Database schema migration utilities

## Technology Stack

### Backend

- **Language**: Node.js (JavaScript/ECMAScript Modules)
- **API**: Native HTTP module for API Gateway, Express.js for internal services
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based token authentication
- **Container Runtime**: Docker
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes

### Frontend

- **Framework**: React
- **Routing**: React Router
- **State Management**: Context API
- **Styling**: CSS-in-JS

## Communication Patterns

### Synchronous Communication

Most service-to-service communication happens synchronously via HTTP/REST:

1. Client sends request to API Gateway
2. API Gateway authenticates and routes to appropriate service
3. Service processes request, possibly communicating with other services
4. Response flows back through API Gateway to client

### Event-Driven Communication

For certain operations, we use event-driven patterns:

1. Service publishes event to event bus (e.g., "ReportSubmitted")
2. Interested services subscribe to events and process them asynchronously
3. This allows for loose coupling and better scalability

## Data Flow

### Property Creation Flow

1. User submits property data via Web Client
2. API Gateway routes to Property Service
3. Property Service validates and stores data
4. Property Service optionally triggers Data Validator agent

### Report Generation Flow

1. User requests report creation for a property
2. Report Service creates new report record
3. Form Service provides required forms for the report type
4. User submits form data which is validated and stored
5. Analysis Service selects comparable properties
6. QC Reviewer agent performs quality check
7. Report Service generates final PDF

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment

- Docker Compose for local development
- Shared database instance
- Services running on different ports

### Production Environment

- Kubernetes for container orchestration
- Horizontal scaling for stateless services
- Database replication for high availability
- Content Delivery Network (CDN) for static assets
- API Gateway with load balancing

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2 integration (planned)

### Data Security

- HTTPS for all communications
- Database encryption at rest
- Sensitive data masking
- Regular security audits

### API Security

- Rate limiting
- Input validation
- CORS configuration
- Security headers

## Monitoring & Observability

### Logging

- Structured JSON logs
- Centralized log aggregation
- Log retention policies

### Metrics

- Service-level metrics
- Business metrics
- Performance metrics

### Tracing

- Distributed tracing across services
- Request correlation IDs
- End-to-end performance analysis

## Future Architectural Considerations

- GraphQL API for more efficient client-server communication
- Event sourcing for audit trail and temporal querying
- Machine learning model integration for advanced valuation
- Geospatial analysis capabilities
- Integration with public records and MLS systems
