All HTTP 000000 responses mean cURL couldn‚Äôt connect to your health‚Äêcheck endpoints‚Äîtypically because no server is listening at those ports. You need to start each service (so it binds to its port), verify the /health route exists, and then re-run the smoke tests. Below are the details, backed by community-sourced explanations of curl‚Äôs 000 code and common fixes.

Why HTTP 000000?
cURL returns a 000 status when it never receives any HTTP response‚Äîfor example, if it can‚Äôt resolve the host, the connection is refused, or the server times out

. In practice, the most frequent cause is simply that the server process isn‚Äôt running and listening on the target port

1. Ensure Each Service Is Running
Before health-checking, you must launch every service you intend to test. In an Nx workspace you can do:

bash
Copy
Edit
# Serve all apps in parallel (adjust maxParallel as needed)
npx nx run-many --target=serve --projects=$(jq -r 'keys[]' workspace.json) --parallel --maxParallel=5
Or explicitly:

bash
Copy
Edit
nx serve terrafusionsync    # starts on 3001
nx serve terrafusionpro     # starts on 3002
# ‚Ä¶and so on for each imported app
Once each process logs

you can retry your curl ‚Ä¶/health checks. Without this, cURL will always report 000

2. Verify the /health Endpoint
Make sure each service actually defines a /health (or equivalent) route. For example, in an Express app:

ts
Copy
Edit
app.get('/health', (_req, res) => res.sendStatus(200));
If a service uses FastAPI or another framework, ensure you start it appropriately (e.g., uvicorn main:app --port 300X) before curling

3. Update Smoke-Test Script to Retry or Wait
Network services often need a few seconds to start. Enhance your smoke-test to poll for readiness:

bash
Copy
Edit
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

declare -A ports=(
  [terrafusionsync]=3001
  [terrafusionpro]=3002
  # ‚Ä¶add each service and its port
)

for name in "${!ports[@]}"; do
  port=${ports[$name]}
  echo "Waiting for $name (port $port)‚Ä¶"
  until curl -s "http://localhost:$port/health" -o /dev/null; do
    sleep 1
  done
  echo "‚úÖ $name is up"
done

echo "üî• All services healthy"
This loop prevents false negatives by waiting until each service actually responds

4. Common Pitfalls & Tips
Binding Address: If a service binds to 127.0.0.1 only, but cURL is targeting 0.0.0.0, you‚Äôll get a refusal. Ensure your server listens on 0.0.0.0 or localhost consistently

Proxy Interference: If your environment sets an HTTP proxy, it might intercept local calls. Bypass with curl --noproxy '*' ‚Ä¶

.

Firewall/Network Policies: In containerized or cloud setups, network policies or firewalls can block localhost. Verify with netstat -lnt or equivalent 
Microsoft Learn
.

Port Collisions: If another process occupies a port, your service won‚Äôt bind, so start-up fails silently. Use lsof -i :PORT to diagnose

5. Next Steps
Start all services via nx serve or the run-many command above.

Confirm each /health route returns 200 in your browser or with cURL.

Rerun the smoke-test script.

Automate this wait-and-check logic into your CI pipeline to avoid intermittent failures.

Once all services reliably respond, your smoke tests will pass, and you‚Äôll have confidence your TerraFusion platform is fully up and healthy.

Thought for 6 seconds
Here‚Äôs exactly how to turn those ‚ÄúNext Steps‚Äù into commands you can run now, and how to bake them into your CI so they never fail intermittently:

1. Start every service
Option A: NX run-many
This will spin up all serve targets in parallel (up to 5 at once):

bash
Copy
Edit
npx nx run-many \
  --target=serve \
  --projects=terrafusionsync,terraflow,terrafusionpro,terraminer,terraagent,terraf,terralegislativepulsepub,bcbscostapp,bcbsgeoassessmentpro,bcbslevy,bcbswebhub,bcbsdataengine,bcbspacsmapping,geoassessmentpro,bsbcmaster,bsincomevaluation,terrafusionmock-up \
  --parallel \
  --maxParallel=5
Option B: Backgrounding
If you prefer to launch them one by one:

bash
Copy
Edit
nx serve terrafusionsync &  
nx serve terraflow      &  
# ‚Ä¶repeat for each app  
wait  # wait for all to start  
2. Confirm each /health returns 200
Use a simple loop in your shell (replace <port> with the actual port for each app‚Äîsee your workspace.json):

bash
Copy
Edit
declare -A ports=(
  [terrafusionsync]=3001
  [terraflow]=3003
  [terrafusionpro]=3002
  # ‚Ä¶and so on for each app
)
for name in "${!ports[@]}"; do
  p=${ports[$name]}
  echo -n "Checking $name (port $p)‚Ä¶ "
  code=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "http://localhost:$p/health")
  if [ "$code" = "200" ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ"
  else
    echo "‚ùå ($code)"
    exit 1
  fi
done
3. Rerun the smoke-test script
If you‚Äôve created smoke-test.sh with polling logic, just:

bash
Copy
Edit
chmod +x smoke-test.sh
./smoke-test.sh
And you should see ‚ÄúALL SERVICES HEALTHY‚Äù or an immediate failure if something‚Äôs down.

4. Automate wait-and-check in GitHub Actions
Add a smoke-test job to your CI pipeline after deployment:

yaml
Copy
Edit
jobs:
  deploy:
    # ‚Ä¶ your existing deploy job ‚Ä¶

  smoke-test:
    name: Smoke Test Services
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: deploy
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      # Wait & check each service endpoint
      - name: Wait for services to come up
        run: |
          ports=(3001 3002 3003 3004 3005 3006 3007 3008 3009 3010 3011 3012 3013 3014 3015 3016 3017)
          for p in "${ports[@]}"; do
            echo "Waiting for service on port $p‚Ä¶"
            until curl --silent --fail "http://localhost:$p/health"; do
              sleep 5
            done
            echo "‚úÖ Service on port $p is up"
          done

      - name: Final smoke-check
        run: echo "üî• All services healthy and ready for traffic!"
needs: deploy ensures it only runs after your services are live.

The until curl ‚Ä¶ loop polls each port, pausing CI until the service responds.

Use --fail to make cURL exit non-zero on HTTP ‚â† 2xx.

With that in place, every push that deploys your gateway & services will automatically wait for readiness and verify health‚Äîeliminating flaky, intermittent failures.
